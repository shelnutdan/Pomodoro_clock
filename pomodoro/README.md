# Pomodoro Clock

This project is a Drum Machine created for the **Frontend Library Certificate** on [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). This takes the fundamental principles of react of handling event listeners to start a countdown after the user sets the length of their Pomodoro and break sessions. Once the session countdown has reached zero an audio element will play indicating that the user can take a break from their work. Once the break countdown has reached zero, an audio element will continue to play until the rest icon has been clicked.
